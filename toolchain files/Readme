Intro: 
Attached are the files used to build the riscv toolchain with the klessydra instruction extensions

1) Download the official riscv toolchain from: 

   https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain

2) -replace the file riscv-opc.c in <path_to_toolchain>/riscv-binutils-gdb/opcode/
   -replace the file riscv-opc.h in <path_to_toolchain>/riscv-binutils-gdb/include/opcode/

3) Build the toolchain using the following commands
    
   ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --with-arch=rv32g --with-abi=ilp32
   make

4) After the build, in order to use both pulpino ri5cy toolchain and klessydra toolchain simultaneusly.
   -copy the make_links.sh into <path_to_klessydra_toolchain>/bin using "sudo cp"
   -chmod +777 make_links.sh
   -sudo ./make_links.sh

5) Add the path of klessydra_toolchain to environmetal variables.

Now if you want to test the toolchain, run commands as such in a terminal: klessydra-unknown-elf-... (e.g. klessydra-unknown-elf-gcc -c file.c)
